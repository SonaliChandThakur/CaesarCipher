# CaesarCipherCaesar Cipher Overview This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique. Users can choose to either encrypt or decrypt a message by specifying a shift amount. The program takes user input for the message, shift amount, and encryption/decryption preference.

Features

Caesar Cipher The program uses the Caesar Cipher algorithm to shift letters in the alphabet based on the specified shift amount.

Encryption and Decryption Users can choose between two modes: 'encode' for encryption and 'decode' for decryption.

User Interaction The program prompts users to input their message, shift amount, and choose between encryption and decryption.

Shift Limit The shift amount is automatically adjusted to be within the valid range (0 to 25) to accommodate large shift values.

Restart Option After processing the input, users have the option to restart the program to encrypt or decrypt another message.

How to Use Run the program. Choose 'encode' to encrypt a message or 'decode' to decrypt. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt. Specify the shift amount (a positive integer). Review the encrypted or decrypted result. Choose to restart the program or exit.
